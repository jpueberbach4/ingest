 Description: Resolves user dataset selection strings into executable tasks
              for the Dukascopy data pipeline.

              The `SelectionResolver` class operates on a collection of
              available Dataset objects and parses selection strings of
              the form:

                  SYMBOL[mods][indicators]/TF[mods][indicators]

              Supported features include:
                - Regex-based symbol matching with wildcards (*)
                - Bracket-aware parsing to safely handle nested expressions
                - Global (symbol-level) and local (timeframe-level) modifiers
                - Indicator definitions enclosed in square brackets
                  (e.g., ema(20) → ema_20)
                - Comma-separated timeframe specifications
                - Validation of requested symbol/timeframe pairs

              The resolver returns structured task definitions containing
              dataset metadata, resolved modifiers, and resolved indicators,
              suitable for downstream ETL or analysis workflows.

     - Python 3.8+
