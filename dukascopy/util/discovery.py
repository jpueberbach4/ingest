 Description: Provides functionality to discover and manage datasets
              for the Dukascopy data pipeline.

              The `DataDiscovery` class scans configured directories for
              dataset files in either binary or CSV format. It supports:
                - Aggregate and resampled directory structures
                - Automatic file extension selection based on configuration
                - Construction of Dataset objects with symbol, timeframe,
                  and file path
                - Sorting datasets by symbol and timeframe

              The discovered datasets are stored internally and returned
              as a sorted list for further processing by downstream
              ETL tasks.

 Requirements:
     - Python 3.8+
     - etl.util.dataclass.Dataset
