Author:      JP Ueberbach
Created:     2025-12-19

Purpose:
    Factory module for selecting and instantiating Dukascopy download engines.

    This file does NOT perform any downloading itself.

    Instead, it provides a single, centralized decision point for choosing
    which download engine implementation to use based on configuration or
    runtime preferences (e.g. HTTP/2 vs legacy requests).

Responsibilities:
    - Abstract engine selection behind a simple interface
    - Return fully initialized download engine instances
    - Provide a sensible default engine choice

Design Notes:
    - Keeps protocol-specific logic out of calling code
    - Makes it trivial to add new engines (e.g. aiohttp, curl bindings)
    - Prevents hard-coding engine classes throughout the codebase

Non-Responsibilities (by design):
    - Network I/O
    - Retry logic
    - Rate-limit handling
    - File persistence
    - Scheduling or orchestration

Usage Example:
    engine = DownloadFactory.get_engine(config)
    engine.download(symbol, date)

Requirements:
    - Python 3.8+
    - Project-specific download engine implementations
