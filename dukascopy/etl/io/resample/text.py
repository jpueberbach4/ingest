 Description:
     Text-based, incremental OHLCV file I/O and aggregation engine.

     This module provides crash-safe, incremental reading, writing, and
     index-tracking for CSV-formatted OHLCV data. It is designed to support
     batch resampling and aggregation pipelines with precise byte-offset
     tracking for resumable processing.

     Key classes:
         - ResampleIOReaderText: Reads batches of CSV rows with byte-offset
           tracking, providing EOF detection and random-access seeking.
         - ResampleIOWriterText: Writes batches of OHLCV data to CSV with
           optional fsync, truncation, flushing, and transactional safety.
         - ResampleIOIndexReaderWriterText: Manages persistent input/output
           offsets for crash-safe incremental processing.

     Features:
         - Batch reading and writing with support for resuming from a
           specific byte offset.
         - Automatic header parsing for input CSV files.
         - Optional fsync to guarantee durability of writes and index updates.
         - Transactional index updates using temporary files and atomic replace.
         - Integration with resampling pipelines or aggregation workflows.

 Usage:
     - Imported and used by resampling or aggregation engines.
     - Supports multiprocessing or forked worker contexts.
     - Enables incremental appending and crash-safe recovery for OHLCV data.

 Requirements:
     - Python 3.8+
     - pandas

 Exceptions:
     - ProcessingError: Raised for file corruption, empty files, or invalid operations.
     - IndexCorruptionError: Raised when an index file is malformed.
     - IndexValidationError: Raised when offsets are invalid.
     - IndexWriteError: Raised on failure to persist index to disk.
