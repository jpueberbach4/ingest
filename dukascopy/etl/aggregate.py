 Description: Incremental OHLCV aggregation engine.

              This module provides:
              - AggregateEngine: Handles incremental appending of daily CSVs 
                to a master symbol file with crash-safe index tracking.
              - AggregateWorker: Manages the aggregation lifecycle for a symbol 
                across a range of dates.

 Requirements:
     - Python 3.8+
     - Pandas
